I am a PhD student in Applied and Computational Mathematics at Princeton University. I am advised by [https://sites.google.com/princeton.edu/matija-bucic/home Matija Bucic] and [https://web.math.princeton.edu/~nalon/ Noga Alon]. I was a predoctoral research fellow at Microsoft Research in the Algorithms and Theory Group where my advisor was [https://rakri.github.io/ Ravishankar Krishnaswamy]. I completed my undergraduate degree in mathematics from UCLA where my advisor was [http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~sahai/ Amit Sahai].\n

My research interests include combinatorics, algorithms and theoretical computer science.\n

Here is my [https://tinyurl.com/varunscv CV.] My email is [varunsiva@princeton.edu].\n
