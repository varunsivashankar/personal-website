I recently completed my undergraduate degree in mathematics from UCLA. I will be joining the Algorithms and Theory group at Microsoft Research as a research fellow in July 2022.\n

I am passionate about theoretical computer science, and in particular, my research interests include algorithms, cryptography, combinatorics and graph theory. My CV is available [https://tinyurl.com/varunscv here.]\n

My advisor at UCLA was [http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~sahai/ Professor Amit Sahai]. I worked with him on research in cryptography in the [http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~theory/ UCLA Theory Group]. I've also done research in combinatorics with [https://math.stanford.edu/~hspink/ Professor Hunter Spink]. Previously, I worked on research in the [https://www.uclaml.org/ UCLA Statistical Machine Learning Lab] with [http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~qgu/index.html Professor Quanquan Gu] and in the [https://sriramlab.dgsom.ucla.edu/pages/ Machine Learning and Genomics Lab] with [http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~sriram/ Professor Sriram Sankararaman].
