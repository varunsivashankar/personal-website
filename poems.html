<h1>Poems</h1>
</div>
<p>Documenting the struggles of my life.
</p>
<h2>Chips</h2>
<p>My stomach rumbled as the clock struck three,<br />
There was no food in the vicinity.<br />
The weather was frigid but I had to eat,<br />
So I bravely walked across the street.
</p>
<p>The vending machine promised salvation,<br />
To deliver me from impending starvation.<br />
Two packs of chips with their salty crunch,<br />
Would make up for my deficient lunch.
</p>
<p>Picked up the first pack and I was thrilled,<br />
But that’s when the tension began to build,<br />
The machine stopped, and so did my heart,<br />
The second so close, yet fate kept us apart.
</p>
<p>I cried in pain at the loss of my snack,<br />
But lo and behold, the machine fought back.<br />
I exclaimed in joy, my prayers were heard,<br />
I grabbed the second and fate threw in a third!
</p>
<p>I only ate two to avoid ruining dinner,<br />
For gluttony is a sin and I am no sinner.<br />
But I saved the third for a rainy day,<br />
To keep the hunger pangs at bay.
</p>
<p>The very next day, I was smacking my lips,<br />
Dreaming about my pre-lunch chips.<br />
But woe is me! Cursed be the thief,<br />
Snack-stealing criminal, harbinger of grief.
</p>
<p>Hell hath no fury like a gambler in plight,<br />
Chips all squandered with no foresight.<br />
&ldquo;Betrayal!&rdquo; I yelled. &ldquo;Deception, treason!&rdquo;<br />
I had lost my spoils for no good reason.
</p>
<p>Don’t count your chickens before they’ve hatched,<br />
In this cruel world they will be snatched.<br />
There’s no free lunch, I learned that day,<br />
The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away.
</p>
<h2>NJ Transit</h2>
<p>The dinky is a beast of yore,<br />
That spares students the weekend bore.<br />
A quick ride to Princeton Junction,<br /> 
Then one more train to civilization!
</p>
<p>Happily I took my seat,<br />
A day in the city can't be beat.<br />
But the years had done a number,<br /> 
The dinky rested in eternal slumber.
</p>
<p>We booked a cab straight to the station,<br /> 
Eager to make our brunch reservation.<br />
Our train had left, but we didn't care,<br /> 
We made the next with time to spare.
</p>
<p>We were on our way, very elated,<br />
To NYC, where eggs awaited.<br />
But before a single station bell,<br /> 
This train died on us as well.
</p>
<p>A rescue train soon came around,<br />
We were told to jump down to the ground,<br /> 
Walking on tracks felt insane,<br /> 
But we had to board the second train.
</p>
<p>The conductor, with a calm demeanor,<br /> 
Said not to touch both trains together,<br /> 
Lest we be electrocuted.<br />
On that note, we were promptly booted.
</p>
<p>We made the switch and then quite soon,<br /> 
I had my morning coffee in the afternoon.<br />
Our troubles were all done and dusted,<br /> 
But the NJ Transit can never be trusted.
</p>
<h2>Mosquitoes</h2>
<p>Some time to rest, some peace of mind,<br />
Is what the man thought he would find,<br />
After a long day on his feet,<br />
In the sweltering Bombay heat.
</p>
<p>He thought he would be left alone,<br />
To endlessly scroll the stupid phone,<br />
Unaware of the dangers in store,<br />
Within the confines of the door. 
</p>
<p>The sun had set, it was the black of night,<br />
That’s when the bastards began the fight.<br />
Armed with the gift of treacherous flight,<br />
The onslaught raged on bite by bite.
</p>
<p>His skin was raw, his spirit defeated,<br />
The blood in his body was very depleted.<br /> 
But when the war was at its most gory,<br />
Out came the racket in all its glory.
</p>
<p>Armed with the power of electricity,<br />
His mind knew no mercy, kindness or pity.<br /> 
A valuable lesson, the mosquitoes learned:<br />
Mess with Varun, and you will be burned.
</p>
<h2>Math</h2>
<p>My notebook is filled, my ink runs dry,<br />
Frustrated, I let out a sigh.<br />
Stubbornness: is that my bane?<br />
Many nights spent, but not in vain.
</p>
<p>Symbols meaningless, in my view,<br />
But seem to hold a tantalizing clue.<br />
A promise of truth, veiled to my eye,<br />
No success yet, but I continue to pry.
</p>
<p>Then, from nowhere, a thought so bold!<br />
Moments later, the passion runs cold.<br />
That thought, like so many before,<br />
Joins the crumpled papers on the floor.
</p>
<p>Breakthroughs rare and failures countless,<br />
A path not easy, that much is doubtless.<br />
But what keeps me going in face of dismay,<br />
Is that I know more than yesterday.</p>
